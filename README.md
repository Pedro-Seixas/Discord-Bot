# Discord-Bot

Discord Bot in python that sends memes from Memedroid

The application uses BeautifulSoup for WebScrapping the Memedroid website and it sends to discord using the discord.py library.
The application also uses mySQL for storing memes links and usernames.
The application had a version where the user was able to send memes from discord to the website using only commands (Selenium), however due to host server and website server it was not possible.
